AncientEmpires
==============

Hobby project developed during last two years in school.

It is game for android, actually port of [AncientEmpires](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Empires_(mobile_game)), a fantasy turn-based tactics game.

The project is unfinished, hovewer it has reached playable state (but I haven't got APK file, sorry).

You may want to know that there are a lot of another ports of AncientEmpires to android, for example [Ancient Empires Reloaded](https://toyknight.net/aeii/).
